# PixelOs GSI

## Build
To get started with building Pixel Experience GSI, you'll need to get familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html) as well as [How to build a GSI](https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations/wiki/How-to-build-a-GSI%3F).

    ```
    mkdir pixel; cd pixel
    ```
- Clone this repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Zainullahorg/Treble_build_pe -b twelve
    ```
